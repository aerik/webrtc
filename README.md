# webrtc
experiments and demos using webrtc

This repository is work-in-progress of my learning about webrtc.  I wanted to share some of my tinkerings in the hope they might be useful to others.

I should give credit to Chris Ball, his "serverless webrtc" provided probably the most understandable example at https://github.com/cjb/serverless-webrtc/ - you can see echos of his code in my prototype.
